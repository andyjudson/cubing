## Cubing Project

I've started this project to help my learning of the CFOP algorithms - inspired by the excellent tutorials from CubeHead, which he has recently added on YouTube. I've also been wanting to dabble with making a cubing web app with animations so i can practice more easily. The cubing.js framework is packed with these features and many i'll not need or likely understand, but the ui it uses needs some love imho. There are also several cheat sheets out there, with all the cases and algorithms, but no simulations - and if you're learning bring these approaches together should help me, and maybe others out there. 

I first started to learn how to solve a rubik's cube using the J Perm beginner method. After weeks of practice on my daily commute to work, I now understand, intuitively cross techniques and the rest of solve seems to be muscle memory and pattern recognition from the practice vs many replays of his YouTube videos. I can read cubing rotation, but I still have to think when translating it into finger moves, or what effect it is causing on the cube pieces. My solve times are consistently around 2 to 3 mins, and whilst I'm not looking to compete, I would like to learn the beginner CFOP methods (intuitive F2L, 2-look OLL, 2-look PLL), and get my timings down to 30 to 60s. Luck as have it, CubeHead has recently churned out an excellent series that I can replay (and have repeatedly!!) as I learn the cases, logic, and moves. This page is a wee project to just make this simpler, and we'll see where how it evolves.
