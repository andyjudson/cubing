## Cubing Project

I've started this project to help my learning of the cubing CFOP algorithms - inspired by the new and excellent tutorials from CubeHead (aka. Milan Struyf), which he has added to his YouTube channel in 2024. I've also been wanting to dabble with making a cubing web app with animations so I can practice more easily. The cubing.js framework (from Lucas Garron) is packed with these features, and many I'll not need or likely ever understand, but the ui/ux is basic by default. There are also several cheat sheets out there, with all the cases and algorithms, but no simulations, and can be quite often covered with advertising. There are some mobile apps that combine aspects of these things but not quite as I want, and I can't obviously build on them. Anyway, this is an experiment to help me and maybe others develop their cubing skills.

I first started to learn how to solve a rubik's cube using the JPerm (aka. Dylan Wang) beginner tutorial. After hours of practice on my daily commute to work, I now understand intuitive cross techniques, with the rest of the solve done through muscle memory and pattern recognition from practice and many replays of his YouTube videos. Whilst, I can read cubing rotation, I still have to think when translating the notation into finger moves, or the effect this will have on the cube pieces.

My solve times are consistently around 2 to 3 mins, and whilst I'm not looking to compete, I would like to learn the CFOP algorithms, starting with intuitive F2L, 2-look OLL, and 2-look PLL. We'll see if I can get my solve times down around 1 min. As luck would have it, CubeHead has recently churned out an excellent beginner CFOP series that I have watched repeatedly!! This site is a wee project to see if it helps that learning, and we'll see where how it evolves.
