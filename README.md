## Cubing Project

I've started to build this site to help my learning of CFOP, based on the recent tutorials from CubeHead. 

I first started to learn how solve a rubik's cube using the J Perm beginner method. After weeks of practice on my daily commute, that has evolved into intuitively understanding the cross, and muscle memory and pattern recognition for the rest, with consistently in timings 2 to 3 mins range. The jump from this level to timings of 30 to 60s is my next challenge, and thus I want to now learn the CFOP beginner method, and as lucky as one can be CubeHead has churned out an excellent new series that I can skip + replay as I learn - this page is a wee project to just make this simpler, and we'll see where how it evolves.

This site is built with [cubing.js](https://github.com/cubing/cubing.js) from Lucas Garron, with thanks to [CubeHead](https://www.youtube.com/@CubeHead) (aka. Milan Struyf) and [J Perm](https://www.youtube.com/@JPerm) (aka. Dylan Wang) for their cubing tutorials.
